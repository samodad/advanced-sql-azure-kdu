**Azure SQL, Power BI & Advanced SQL Examples**

This repository contains **hands-on tasks and resources** focused on Azure SQL Database, advanced SQL queries, and Power BI integration for educational use (e.g., classroom, labs, and projects). The materials are designed to help learners understand how to work with **cloud-based data platforms** and analytics tools.

## 🧠 Overview

The goal of this repository is to:

* Demonstrate **Azure SQL Database usage** with practical SQL scripts.
* Provide **Power BI examples** connected to Azure SQL for visualization.
* Showcase **advanced SQL query techniques** useful in real-world analytics.

Includes sample `.sql` scripts, Power BI reports, and development files that teach you how to apply Azure data services in a project setting.
